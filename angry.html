🤗🤗🤗🤗😗😘😘😚😙 hihi, super palangga tlg yaan. d natin sla bati baby okaay? tssk. for now, we can try to stay calm and iwas sa
stress2 :) bcs it's rlly not worth it, ure strong nd it's not worth ur time. i understand nmn that having these emotions are completely
normal. anger, frustration, rage, irritation, dissapointment, bitterness, disgust, and dami dami pa, we are all subjected to these emotions
which is completely valid but what's not valid is our actions.<br>
i played uu a short piece heheh :)) uu can listen to it whenever uu like po, i hope it helps. uu can click 'songs' tas 'instrumental' but uu 
can also click here:<br><br>
