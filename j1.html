        today, nothing's changed but there was more hope. i wish i had been able to communicate all my side properly,
        but instead i owned up everything, kind of an ass move and i dont know if tama ba to lahat or hindi, everything
        feels like a dream, unreal, hapdi. last night i slept late even tho i had to wake up early, i was so sleepy but everytime
        i doze off, everything keeps on flashing back sa eyes and mind ko, and a lot of overthinking, eventually naka sleep lang. another
        night na walang goodnight baby, sleepwell, i miss you, take care, i love you so much. i woke up having small sleep, even woke up before
        my alarm, doesnt matter. we had to wake up early bcs punta kaming ic. when we arrived, nagpa lbc si khalil bcs inutusan siya ng mama niya,
        so nagpa lbc nalang din ako ng parting gift ko kay ivs, just a simple pic lang naman. di sana kami tuloy kung hindi urgent ang lbc ni khalil. 
        <br><br><br>
        suroy2 lang kami mall, nag get ako llao llao kasi fave niya un, nag eat kami popnwings after kasi we never got to go there kasi always closed. 
        after eating, gusto ko pumunta SPOT bcs don tambayan namin when we laag sa early days, turns out demolished na pala, quite ironic sa situation
        namin now haha. pumunta nalang kami watever, tambayan din namin un eh, and very sad bcs nakaka relapse. we sang a lot, nd super loud, kind of theraputic
        pero it doesnt help, nothing helps.

        we walked papuntang tibanga just to see yardside and page, she used to go there with her friends so i wanted to see kahit i already saw na, kahit wala siya don. 
        we passed by meku, where we got our first sakpan hahaha. i really miss mag school sa ic kasi andon siya, i need her sb, kahit sinabi niya wala siyang pake. 
        we waited grab papuntang paseo pero tagal, so nag jeep nalang kami, when we arrived i felt everything, i reminesced everything. we talked about lahat, it was so peaceful
        it made me sad, i can never be in peace without her, all the memories, all the conversations, everything. natandaan ko lahat, i pondered a lot. 
        we talked a lot doon, no laughs, no smiles,for the first time. we tried golf kart don, i still remember the time nag golf kart kami together and mas magaling pa siya sakin mag drive 
        nakaka lovestruck talaga. umuwi na kami after. i was actually hoping makita ko siya somewhere sa lahat ng pinuntahan namin, i couldnt go sa bahay nila kasi walang time and kind of risky 
        but damn i would though, but would she answer my call ba kung pupunta ako? lalabas ba siya if hintayin ko siya doon nang walang sabi? ig ill just make time soon.
        <br><br><br>
        she prolly wont be reading this, but i made this journal because i was planning to make one on a notebook or what, but ig good training din 'to. she never got the news na line of uno ako all except sa 
        mat and two subs na wala pang update. i tried my best para maka kuha better grades, kasi i really want to be lapit sakanya, and ofc ill continue this kahit walang pag asa. after all, siya naman
        dahilan san galing lakas ko eh. anyways that was kinda it on day 1.
