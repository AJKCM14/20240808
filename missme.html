            hi love, been a while since we've seen eo or talk, ik i made a lot of mistakes during our relationship but even though we're not together na,
            i'm still trying my best to be better maybe for me? but most of it is for you. i still love you and of course as always, i hate me. i understand
            you dont miss the me today, what you really miss is actually your anton, your uno.

            missing you really hurts and this is all my fault, lahat ng nangyari. you were really all i needed sa life ko. i still love you like i've ever
            loved you before and i'll continue to love you always, forever.

            ill still miss you, maybe even more than the way i missed u before. all the laughs and cries we had together, the way you made me feel, understood,
            valid, cherished, the way you listen, the way you look, the way you complain, the way you hold my hands, the way you hug me, the way you make me feel
            the pogiest hubby in the world.

            before we ended, you made it sound like parang wala na talaga, but ill still keep on hoping, and ill still love and miss you so much. i will cherish
            the moments we had together bcs you were the best thing that happened in my whole life, all the moments we had together, every second, ill continue to
            relive everything bcs i know i can never love anyone the way i love you.

            i really miss you so much baby
