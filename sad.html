peace, ease, fulfillment, love, confidence, assurance, and many many more. dont lose hope baby, i beleive in uu and uu shld
beleive in urself din kaya yan :>.<br><br><br>
Here are ayahs from the Qur'an, there are some na baka na see mo na or alam mo na but whether u know or not, i think these are
very beautiful messages and i beleive a very beautiful woman deserves something beautiful din:
<br>
ᯓᡣ𐭩 “Verily, with hardship comes ease.” — Surah Ash-Sharh (94:6)<br>
this means, even when life feels heavy, Allah promises that every hardship is paired with ease — not after it, 
but with it. Your pain is not permanent, relief is already on its way.
<br>
ᯓᡣ𐭩 “Do not lose hope, nor be sad. You will surely be victorious if you are true in faith.” — Surah Al-Imran (3:139)<br>
dont let sadness convince you that you are weak. Allah sees your struggles and your patience — victory, peace, and light will 
come to those who keep faith.
<br>
ᯓᡣ𐭩 “And He found you lost and guided you.” — Surah Ad-Duha (93:7)<br>
even when you feel lost, remember: Allah has never left you. just as He guided you before, He will guide you again — your heart 
will find its way.
<br>
ᯓᡣ𐭩 “Indeed, Allah is with the patient.” — Surah Al-Baqarah (2:153)<br>
you are never alone in your pain. every tear, every quiet prayer — Allah is with you through it all, closer than you can imagine.
<br>
ᯓᡣ𐭩 “So remember Me; I will remember you.” — Surah Al-Baqarah (2:152)<br>
even a small remembrance of Allah — a whisper, a sigh, a silent du’a — reaches Him. And when you remember Him, He remembers you 
with mercy and love.
<br>
ᯓᡣ𐭩 “My mercy encompasses all things.” — Surah Al-A’raf (7:156)<br>
no matter how heavy your heart feels, know that Allah’s mercy is vast enough to hold all your pain — and turn it into peace.
