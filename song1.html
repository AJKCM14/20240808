        <a id="titlel">Those Eyes<a>
            
        When we're out in a crowd, laughing loud
        And nobody knows why

        When we're lost at a club, getting drunk
        And you give me that smile

        Going home in the back of a car
        And your hand touches mine

        When we're done making love and you look up
        And give me those eyes

        'Cause all of the small things that you do
        Are what remind me why I fell for you

        And when we're apart and I'm missing you
        I close my eyes and all I see is you
        And the small things you do

        When you call me at night
        While you're out getting high with your friends
        Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said

        'Cause all of the small things that you do
        Are what remind me why I fell for you

        And when we're apart and I'm missing you
        I close my eyes and all I see is you
        And the small things you do

        When we're done making love
        And you look up and give me those eyes

        'Cause all of the small things that you do
        Are what remind me why I fell for you
        And when we're apart and I'm missing you
        I close my eyes and all I see is you

        And the small things you do
        All the small things you do
