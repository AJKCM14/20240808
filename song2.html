        Through drought and famine, natural disasters
        My baby has been around for me
        Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
        None of that could ever make me leave

        Every time I look into your eyes I see it
        You're all I need
        Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
        Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
        Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

        And when we're making love
        Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
        It's only the two of us
        Everything I need's between those thighs
        Every time I look into your eyes I see it
        You're all I need
        Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
        Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
        Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you

        And I'll take some time
        Just to be thankful
        That I had days full of you, you
        Before it winds down into
        The memories, It's all just memories
        Don't you love when I come around
        Build you up then I take you down
        Don't you love when I come around
        Build you up then I take...
        Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
        Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you
        
        This feels like summer
        Girl you make me feel so alive
        Just be my lover
        Girl you'll lead me to paradise
